MySQL Data Types (Version 8.0)
In MySQL there are three main data types: string, numeric, and date and time.

MySQL String data types
In MySQL, a string can hold anything from plain text to binary data such as images or files. Strings can be compared and searched based on pattern matching by using the LIKE operator, regular expression, and full-text search.

The following table shows the string data types in MySQL:

String Types	Description
 CHAR		A fixed-length nonbinary (character) string
 VARCHAR	A variable-length non-binary string
 BINARY		A fixed-length binary string
 VARBINARY	A variable-length binary string
 TINYBLOB	A very small BLOB (binary large object)
 BLOB		A small BLOB (Binary Large Object)
 MEDIUMBLOB	A medium-sized BLOB
 LONGBLOB	A large BLOB
 TINYTEXT	A very small non-binary string
 TEXT		A small non-binary string
 MEDIUMTEXT	A medium-sized non-binary string
 LONGTEXT	A large non-binary string
 ENUM		An enumeration; each column value may be assigned one enumeration member
 SET		A set; each column value may be assigned zero or more SET members

MySQL numeric data types
In MySQL, you can find all SQL standard numeric types including exact number data type and approximate numeric data types including integer, fixed-point and floating-point. In addition, MySQL also has BIT data type for storing bit values. Numeric types can be signed or unsigned except for the BIT type.

The following table shows the summary of numeric types in MySQL:

Numeric Types	Description
 TINYINT	A very small integer
 SMALLINT	A small integer
 MEDIUMINT	A medium-sized integer
 INT		A standard integer
 BIGINT		A large integer
 DECIMAL	A fixed-point number
 FLOAT		A single-precision floating point number
 DOUBLE		A double-precision floating point number
 BIT		A bit field

MySQL date and time data types
MySQL provides types for date and time as well as the combination of date and time. In addition, MySQL supports the timestamp data type for tracking the changes in a row of a table. If you just want to store years without dates and months, you can use the YEAR data type.

The following table illustrates the MySQL date and time data types:

Date&Time Types	Description
 DATE		A date value in CCYY-MM-DD format
 TIME		A time value in hh:mm:ss format
 DATETIME	A date and time value inCCYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ssformat
 TIMESTAMP	A timestamp value in CCYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss format
 YEAR		A year value in CCYY or YY format
